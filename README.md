# Can a temperature chamber be made using heat lamps?

These heating lamps, for the use in which I discovered them, are used to dry automotive paint on different surfaces. However if we want to control this temperature we need to control the intensity of the lamp. However these lamps work directly connected to the AC signal and to control the intensity of these we need to control the input signal by applying phase control techniques.
